# House Price Prediction using SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost

This project aims to predict house prices using supervised learning algorithms: **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, **Random Forest**, and **XGBoost**. The project also involves model comparison, hyperparameter tuning, and feature importance analysis.

## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to build predictive models for house prices using various machine learning algorithms. We start by comparing the performance of SVM, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The best-performing model is then tuned for improved accuracy, and feature importance is calculated to understand the influence of different features on house prices.
